# Django REST API Documentation

This Django project implements a custom REST API with token-based authentication. Users can register an account, login to retrieve their authentication token, and perform CRUD operations on a custom model. Below is detailed documentation for each endpoint.

  - 404 Not Found: User with the specified ID does not exist.

## Testing and Validation

To test the functionalities, you can use tools like curl, Postman, or any API testing tool. Ensure to include the necessary headers and parameters as described above.

### Test Cases

1. **User Registration:**
   - Send a POST request to `/api/register/` with valid user details.
   - Verify that the response status is 201 Created.

2. **User Login:**
   - Send a POST request to `/api/login/` with valid login credentials.
   - Verify that the response status is 200 OK and contains the authentication token.

3. **List All Users:**
   - Send a GET request to `/api/users/` with a valid authentication token.
   - Verify that the response status is 200 OK and contains a list of user objects.

4. **Retrieve User Details:**
   - Send a GET request to `/api/users/<user_id>/` with a valid authentication token.
   - Verify that the response status is 200 OK and contains details of the specified user.

5. **Update User Details:**
   - Send a PUT request to `/api/users/<user_id>/` with valid updated user details and a valid authentication token.
   - Verify that the response status is 200 OK and user details are updated.

6. **Delete User Account:**
   - Send a DELETE request to `/api/users/<user_id>/` with a valid authentication token.
   - Verify that the response status is 204 No Content, indicating the successful deletion of the user account.

### API Keys

For testing purposes, use the authentication token obtained during the login process. This token should be included in the `Authorization` header for authenticated endpoints.

**Note**: Ensure to replace `<user_id>` and other placeholders with actual values in the API documentation and during testing.

Description
This Django project integrates Text Completion and Image Recognition REST APIs into a Django app. It provides functionalities for automated content generation and image recognition. The APIs use third-party services such as OpenAI API and Google Cloud Vision API for text completion and image recognition, respectively.

Installation
Install necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install django djangorestframework python-decouple requests
Create a .env file in the project's root directory with the following content:

env
Copy code
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Replace your_django_secret_key with a secure Django secret key, and your_openai_api_key with your actual OpenAI API key.

Create a new Django project:

bash
Copy code
django-admin startproject your_project
cd your_project
Create a new Django app:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py startapp your_app
Continue with the implementation as provided in the previous response.
